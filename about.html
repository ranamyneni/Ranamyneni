	<p class="aboutText">&emsp;&emsp;Krys Lee’s short story “Drifting House” depicts a treacherous journey from a northern mining town in North Korea to the Chinese border. The story is set decades after the end of the Korean War in 1953, which led to the Korean Demilitarized Zone and the separation between North and South Korea. Due to an economic crisis, North Korea was dependent on the Soviet Union for most of their food and supplies. In the 1990s, under the dictatorship of Kim Jong-il, the decline of the Soviet Union led to a deadly famine which brought many people to starvation. The famine and poor economic conditions in North Korea drove people to make the journey across the Tumen river to China, just like the brothers in “Drifting House.” At this time, people were willing to take great risks and make unimaginable sacrifices in hopes of finding better lives on the other side. </p>
	<p class="aboutText">&emsp;&emsp;As Drifting House recounts the story of a group of young siblings who attempt to go after their mother and cross the border from North Korea into China, they are on their own, and the journey is very cold and treacherous. Their story is not exactly unique, as many North Koreans of all ages and backgrounds were forced to make the same journey in hopes of a better life. As hunger, fatigue, and hypothermia set in, Woncheol, the oldest brother is forced to kill his youngest sister, as she is too weak to walk on her own, and they are too weak to continue carrying her. The pair of brothers continue on, yet Woncheol is constantly haunted by visions of his younger sister. When they finally reach the border, a guard catches them as they try to cross a river. Choecheol, the younger brother, is able to keep running, but Woncheol is distracted as the ghost of his younger sister keeps getting in his way. Eventually he stops resisting, and seems to be at peace as the story comes to an end in that moment. The fate of the two brothers is unclear, yet it is unlikely that either of them would ever be successful in their trip. </p>

	<h4 style="text-align:center; padding-bottom: 15px;">Why we chose to adapt <i>Drifting house</i> in this manner</h4>
	<p class="aboutText">&emsp;&emsp;We have chosen to adapt the text using an interactive map with different points detailing different scenes in Drifting House because it visually shows the idea that as people cross borders, they still hold ties to their past while continuing on their path. By visually conveying this idea using an interactive map, we can allow users to directly interact with the story behind Drifting House and understand the different journeys of the characters, while also learning about the important scenes that impacted those journeys. Due to the purely textual nature of the original text, presenting a visual depiction of their journey also provides context for the audience and can help them understand why the boys didn't attempt to escape into South Korea, as most North Korean defectors do. We are using pop ups to display these scenes because the user can click on parts of the map and story that they are more interested in learning about, so it allows for a personal connection with the text. The user is not forced to read paragraphs of information that they aren’t engrossed by, and can instead choose what they want their experience to be by clicking along different parts of the map, essentially choosing their own path. </p>

	<h4 style="text-align:center; padding-bottom: 15px;">The ethics of representing migrants' journeys</h4>
	<p class="aboutText">&emsp;&emsp;Representing any immigrant’s story comes with the necessity to consider the ethics of retelling the harsh realities of crossing borders. In this case, because the story we are adapting deals with the fictitious but nonetheless realistic tribulations of two young North Korean boys, we must contextualize our adaptation with our efforts to ethically show their suffering. Firstly, defecting from North Korea is not a purely individual action; the North Korean regime severely deters defecting by punishing defectors’ families and communities who are left in the country. To this point, we try to acknowledge the fact that the boys’ mother leaving them came with much mental anguish to the children, and that they too have to face the guilt of leaving friends behind. Furthermore, we want to clarify that we are representing the story of two individual immigrants and not by any means trying to generalize or extend our adaptation to include all people who have attempted to escape North Korea. Lastly, while we tried to make our map and the boys’ route textually accurate, we took some creative liberty in creating the map. This was also further impeded by the notorious difficulty of cartographing North Korea’s landscape.</p>

	<h4 style="text-align:center; padding-bottom: 15px;">Who this adaptation is meant for</h4>
	<p class="aboutText">&emsp;&emsp;While Krys Lee’s short story Drifting House is graphic in certain passages of the text, our adaptation of the narrative will be more suited for all ages. A possible target audience that will be interacting with our adaptation includes fellow Georgia Tech students, as well as professors and other adults in the English department, however, our primary audience will be our fellow students. The interactive experience that our peers will have as they click through our visual adaptation of Drifting House is important, as it will give them a better understanding of international history that still has lasting effects today. While these students are already familiar with the text and have been considering border rhetorics, we also feel that this adaptation can benefit people who have a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about the atrocities that the North Korean dictatorship is committing, and we hope that this can bring awareness to what North Korean people actually go through.</p>
