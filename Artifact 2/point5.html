		crunch of snow, powdery bones. Even with newspaper folded into his ears, he 
		heard the whispering sounds of Obba. Obba. From all four sides, she seemed to 
		call him. 
		 
		Other visions followed. 
		 
		The bushes keened with animal sounds. He whirled, a rubber band out of his 
		pocket ready to fire. But there was no squirrel, no soldier casting a fatal shadow; 
		only their sister. Her pallid skin. She leapt from rock to rock like a fawn. She 
		smiled and wiggled her tiny fingers at him in the air, showing him, no hands! His 
		breath came in ragged gasps. Still, her waifish figure stood before him. The gourd 
		shape of her forehead. Her face, an ivory varnish. She pulled a thread, unravelled 
		her entire sweater before his next breath. Naked, her body flamed blue with heat.”
		
		In this passage, Woncheol has already choked Gukhwa to death, a tough, fateful decision he had made to spare Gukhwa from the dreadful expedition he and Choecheol had laid out in front of them. Woncheol is haunted by Gukhwa’s figure, his thoughts of her plaguing his vision throughout his treacherous journey. The ghost of Gukhwa is most vividly described in this specific passage, as illustrated in the digital drawing. This visual interpretation of Gukhwa’s figure serves to depict Woncheol’s perspective of a journey fraught with remorseful apparitions. The drawing was done in Adobe Photoshop 2022.
